Suppose you are a traveller on a 2D grid. 
You begin in the top left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom right corner.
You may only move down or right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid of dimensions M x N?

Sample Input/ Output:

Input: M = 0,  N = 0
Output: 0 way

Input: M = 1,  N = 1
Output: 1 way

Input: M = 2,  N = 3
Output: 3 ways
